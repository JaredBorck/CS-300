## Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
In these projects, I was building systems to manage and display course data. The main goal was to use different data structures to load, store, search, and sort information efficiently.

**How did you approach the problem?**  
I compared multiple data structures—vector, hash table, and binary search tree—to understand which ones work best for storing and retrieving course data. Understanding the strengths of each structure helped guide my design.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
I had some trouble getting file input and tree ordering just right, but using print statements and testing small input files helped me debug and verify the logic.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
It showed me how important it is to choose the right data structure early on. Performance and memory usage can change drastically based on that decision.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I focused more on separating functionality into functions and using clear naming and structure. This helps make the code easier to understand and update later.
